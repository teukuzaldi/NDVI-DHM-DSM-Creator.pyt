I create a python toolbox which contained 3 separated tools namely NDVI Calculator, DSM Creator, and DHM Creator tool.

<br>
### **NDVI Calculator:** 
My Ph.D. The project in the future will revolve around NDVI calculation,
I believe creating this tool will save me a lot of time rather than manually using a raster calculator.
This can be integrated into a larger project if we loop them from Python.

**Test Data: Band4 and Band5 Landsat.**<br>
**Band 4 & Band 5:** https://github.com/teukuzaldi/NRS-528-Python-in-GIS/blob/main/Final_Tool_12/Test_Data/Band4_Band5_Landsat.rar

### **DSM & DHM Creator:** 
My major paper in the MESM program is about tree risk analysis in Rhode Island,
running DHM from raw LAS 2018 dataset required a lot of time because this analysis will run for the entire Rhode Island,
to save me some time on this one I create DHM creator,
DSM creator for this one since to create DHM at least 2 tools required and each tool has there an error here and there,
which consume times to figure that out.
So I created a tool that prioritizes stability and cut through some unnecessary error.

**Test Data:**<br>
**DEM URI:** https://github.com/teukuzaldi/NRS-528-Python-in-GIS/blob/main/Final_Tool_12/Test_Data/DEM_URI.rar
**<br>LAS Dataset:** https://data.rigis.org/TOPO/2011/LAS/19_02884594.zip

if **LAS Dataset** link does not work, you can do it manually by using this method below
LAS data can be obtained from :
